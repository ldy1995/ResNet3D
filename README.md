# ResNet3D
This is a ResNet-based post-processing 3D network for reducing the low-dose noise and artifacts.

## Requirements

* Linux Platform
* NVIDIA GPU + CUDA 
* PyTorch == 1.0.1
* Python3.6
* Numpy1.16
* scipy1.2

## Dataset Descriptions

* CT scanning data of ten patients from [Mayo Clinic](http://www.aapm.org/GrandChallenge/LowDoseCT/) 

## Results

The following three images show current results of the network for restoring the low-dose CT images at  transverse, coronal and sagittal planes, respectively.
